# About this project

This is a simple university assignment aiming to find the optimal DAG (Directed Acyclical Graph) for each dataset (titanic & wine). Altough we will not publish the exercise subject on github because of our teacher's copyright, it is similar to [this exercise](https://aa228.stanford.edu/project-1/).
